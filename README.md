==============

This repository contains working samples illustrating some of the options for building client software to the IBM Internet of Things Cloud
on the TI BeagleBone.

There are currently 2 samples with similar function implemented in node.js and node-red.

Sample Recipes for BeagleBone
=============================
Use a BeagleBone Black board to connect a TI SensorTag to the IoT cloud. Then you can visualize the data generated by the SensorTag's temperature, humidity, pressure, accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer sensors.

Ingredients
===========
For this recipe you will need:

a BeagleBone Black
a TI SensorTag CC2541
a Bluetooth Low Energy (Type 4) USB adapter to connect the SensorTag to the BeagleBone (for example, http://plugable.com/products/usb-bt4le). 

Prepare
=======
You need to complete a few tasks to prepare your BeagleBone for connection to the IoT Cloud.  
1. Get Debian Linux for your BeagleBone. You can install Debian Linux on a Micro SD card and boot the  BeagleBone from there. For downloading Debian Linux and booting from a Micro SD card, see http://beagleboard.org/latest-images.
2. With Debian Linux running, connect your BeagleBone to a Windows or Linux computer, using the supplied USB cable. If you are using a Windows, you need to install some drivers to access your BeagleBone, see http://beagleboard.org/Getting Started.
3. Run SSH on your computer and connect to the BeagleBoard at 192.168.7.2.  
4. Insert the USB BLE addaptor into the USB socket and confirm that the SensorTag can be detected using "hcitool lescan", you will have to press the side button on the SensorTag.
5. You also need the BeagleBone to have internet access, this can be gateway over the USB link or provided separately through the BeagleBone Ethernet port.


Connect
=======
Setup and connect instructions can be found in the README.md files in the sample direcory.


Visualize
=========
You can now use the IoT web site to visualize the data that your SensorTag is generating.

Enter your MAC address in the <name> Field. 
You jump to the IoT web site, where you can see a visual representation of the output from the sensors on your SensorTag.
